# Security Policy

## Report a Vulnerability

If you found a security vulnerability in Haystack, please send a message to
[security@deepset.ai](mailto:security@deepset.ai).

If possible, please include:

1. Reproducible steps on how to trigger the vulnerability.
2. A description on why you are convinced that it exists.
3. Any information you may have on active exploitations of the vulnerability (zero-day).

## Vulnerability Response

Your report will be acknowledged within 5 business days, we will do a preliminary analysis
to confirm that the vulnerability is a plausible claim or decline the report otherwise.

Any information shared with the deepset security team will stay within deepset and will not
be disclosed, except as required to get the issue fixed or to coordinate a vendor response.

We will keep the reporter updated as the security issue moves through our process.

Our goal is to disclose bugs as soon as possible once a user mitigation is available. We
will set a disclosure date once the bug is well-understood (in consultation with the bug
reporter and Haystack maintainers).
