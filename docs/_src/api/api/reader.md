## FARMReader

```python
class FARMReader(BaseReader)
```

Transformer based model for extractive Question Answering using the FARM framework (https://github.com/deepset-ai/FARM).
While the underlying model can vary (BERT, Roberta, DistilBERT, ...), the interface remains the same.

|  With a FARMReader, you can:

 - directly get predictions via predict()
 - fine-tune the model on QA data via train()

<a id="farm.FARMReader.train"></a>

#### train

```python
def train(data_dir: str, train_filename: str, dev_filename: Optional[str] = None, test_filename: Optional[str] = None, use_gpu: Optional[bool] = None, batch_size: int = 10, n_epochs: int = 2, learning_rate: float = 1e-5, max_seq_len: Optional[int] = None, warmup_proportion: float = 0.2, dev_split: float = 0, evaluate_every: int = 300, save_dir: Optional[str] = None, num_processes: Optional[int] = None, use_amp: str = None, checkpoint_root_dir: Path = Path("model_checkpoints"), checkpoint_every: Optional[int] = None, checkpoints_to_keep: int = 3, caching: bool = False, cache_path: Path = Path("cache/data_silo"))
```

Fine-tune a model on a QA dataset. Options:
- Take a plain language model (e.g. `bert-base-cased`) and train it for QA (e.g. on SQuAD data)
- Take a QA model (e.g. `deepset/bert-base-cased-squad2`) and fine-tune it for your domain (e.g. using your labels collected via the haystack annotation tool)

Checkpoints can be stored via setting `checkpoint_every` to a custom number of steps. 
If any checkpoints are stored, a subsequent run of train() will resume training from the latest available checkpoint.

```

Fine-tune a model on a QA dataset using logit-based distillation. You need to provide a teacher model that is already finetuned on the dataset
and a student model that will be trained using the teacher's logits. The idea of this is to increase the accuracy of a lightweight student model.
using a more complex teacher.

#### predict

```python
def predict(query: str, documents: List[Document], top_k: Optional[int] = None) -> Dict
```

Use loaded TableQA model to find answers for a query in the supplied list of Documents
of content_type ``'table'``.

Returns dictionary containing query and list of Answer objects sorted by (desc.) score.
WARNING: The answer scores are not reliable, as they are always extremely high, even if
         a question cannot be answered by a given table.

:param query: Query string
:param documents: List of Document in which to search for the answer. Documents should be
                  of content_type ``'table'``.
:param top_k: The maximum number of answers to return
:return: Dict containing query and answers

## RCIReader

```python
class RCIReader(BaseReader)
```

Table Reader model based on Glass et al. (2021)'s Row-Column-Intersection model.
See the original paper for more details:
Glass, Michael, et al. (2021): "Capturing Row and Column Semantics in Transformer Based Question Answering over Tables"
(https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-main.96/)

Each row and each column is given a score with regard to the query by two separate models. The score of each cell
is then calculated as the sum of the corresponding row score and column score. Accordingly, the predicted answer is
the cell with the highest score.

Pros and Cons of RCIReader compared to TableReader:
+ Provides meaningful confidence scores
+ Allows larger tables as input
- Does not support aggregation over table cells
- Slower

#### predict

```python

```

Use loaded RCI models to find answers for a query in the supplied list of Documents
of content_type ``'table'``.

Returns dictionary containing query and list of Answer objects sorted by (desc.) score.
The existing RCI models on the HF model hub don"t allow aggregation, therefore, the answer will always be
composed of a single cell.

:param query: Query string
:param documents: List of Document in which to search for the answer. Documents should be
                  of content_type ``'table'``.
:param top_k: The maximum number of answers to return
:return: Dict containing query and answers
