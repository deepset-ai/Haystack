enhancements:
  - |
    Add new `Pipeline` init argument `max_runs_per_component`, this has the same identical
    behaviour as the existing `max_loops_allowed` argument but is more descriptive of its actual effects.
  - |
    Add new `PipelineMaxLoops` to reflect new `max_runs_per_component` init argument
deprecations:
  - |
    `Pipeline` init argument `max_loops_allowed` is deprecated in favor of `max_runs_per_component`.
  - |
    `PipelineMaxLoops` exception is deprecated in favor of `PipelineMaxComponentRuns`.
