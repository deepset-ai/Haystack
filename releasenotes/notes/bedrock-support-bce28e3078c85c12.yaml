    Amazon Bedrock models are now supported in Haystack. All currently available
    models are supported, including the ones that are already announced
    (e.g. Llamma-2-70b-chat). The models can be used in the same way as other
    models in Haystack using its model ids as `model_name_or_path` (see
    https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-ids-arns.html).

    For example, the following code will load the Llama 2 Chat 13B model:
    ```python
    from haystack.nodes import PromptNode

    prompt_node = PromptNode(model_name_or_path="meta.llama2-13b-chat-v1")
    ```
