    If an LLM-based evaluator (e.g., `Faithfulness` or `ContextRelevance`) is initialised with `raise_on_failure=False`, and if a call to an LLM fails or an LLM outputs an invalid JSON, it returns `np.nan` and continues the evaluation.
    The user is notified with a warning indicating the number of requests that failed.
