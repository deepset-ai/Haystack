   Improved the HTML content extraction by iteratively using a prioritized list of content extractors until the content
   is successfully retrieved. This update ensures that the specific extractor chosen by the user is prioritized, but falls
   back to other extractors in a predefined order if the initial extraction fails. This enhancement minimizes the risk
   of failing to extract content from HTML sources, leading to increased robustness in content retrieval processes.
