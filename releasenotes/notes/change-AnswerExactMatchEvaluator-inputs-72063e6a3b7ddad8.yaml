    When using `evaluator = AnswerExactMatchEvaluator()` the code should be changed from
    ```
    result = evaluator.run(
        ground_truth_answers=[["Berlin"], ["Paris"]],
        predicted_answers=[["Berlin"], ["Lyon"]],
    )
    ```
    to:
    ```
    result = evaluator.run(
        ground_truth_answers=["Berlin", "Paris"],
        predicted_answers=["Berlin", "Lyon"],
    )
    ```

    The inputs of the AnswerExactMatchEvaluator components were changed from:

    - ground_truth_answers: List[List[str]], predicted_answers: List[List[str]]

    to:

    - ground_truth_answers: List[str], predicted_answers: List[str]

    This change makes all metrics in Haystack core and in integrations, statistical and model-based, consistent in the inputs they expect.
