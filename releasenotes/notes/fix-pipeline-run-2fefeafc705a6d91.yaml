    Major refactoring of `Pipeline.run()` to fix multiple bugs.
    We moved from a mostly graph-based to a dynamic dataflow driven execution logic.
    Check your pipeline executions carefully to see if their output changes.
fixes:
- |
    - acyclic pipelines with multiple lazy variadic components not running all components
    - cyclic pipelines not passing intermediate outputs to components outside the cycle
    - cyclic pipelines with two or more optional or greedy variadic edges showing unexpected execution behavior
    - cyclic pipelines with two cycles sharing an edge raising errors
