    Fixes multiple bugs in the pipeline-run-method:
    - acyclic pipelines with multiple lazy variadic components not running all components
    - cyclic pipelines not passing intermediate outputs to components outside the cycle
    - cyclic pipelines with two or more optional or greedy variadic edges showing unexpected execution behavior
    - cyclic pipelines with two cycles sharing an edge raising errors
