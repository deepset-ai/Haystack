    Fix issue that could lead to remote code execution when using insecure Jinja template in the following Components:

    - `PromptBuilder`
    - `ChatPromptBuilder`
    - `OutputAdapter`
    - `ConditionalRouter`

    The same issue has been fixed in the `PipelineTemplate` class too.

    This is also a breaking change as we can't support user types as outputs of `OutputAdapter` and `ConditionalRouter` anymore.
