# Summary

Brief explanation of the feature.

# Basic example

When applicable, write a snippet of code showing how the new feature would
be used.

# Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected
outcome?

Please focus on explaining the motivation so that if this RFC is not accepted,
the motivation could be used to develop alternative solutions. In other words,
enumerate the constraints you are trying to solve without coupling them too
closely to the solution you have in mind.

# Detailed design

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody
familiar with Haystack to understand, and for somebody familiar with the
implementation to implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases,
and include examples of how the feature is used. Any new terminology should be
defined here.

# Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this? Please consider:

- implementation cost, both in term of code size and complexity
- whether the proposed feature can be implemented as a separate package, outside of Haystack
- the impact on teaching people Haystack
- integration of this feature with other existing and planned features
- cost of migrating existing Haystack pipelines (is it a breaking change?)

There are tradeoffs to choosing any path. Attempt to identify them here.

# Alternatives

What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

# Adoption strategy

If we implement this proposal, how will existing Haystack users adopt it? Is
this a breaking change? Can we write a migration script?

# How we teach this

Would the acceptance of this proposal mean the documentation must be re-organized
or altered? Does it change how Haystack is taught to new developers at any level?

How should this feature be taught to existing Haystack users (e.g. a page in the docs,
a tutorial, ...).

# Unresolved questions

Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still
TBD?
